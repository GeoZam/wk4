Q1: Choose three of the collections you have learned (concrete classes)Â and think of a scenario in which it
would be most appropriate to use that collection over the others. You will be presenting the scenario to the 
class and letting them guess what collection you are talking about.

Scenario1: 
A black box of different fruits, want to go take 1 out each time and record its type of fruit 
in each type.

Collections1:
HashSet, LinkedHashSet, ArrayList

Best Option1: HashSet, because there's no order, and don't need to be sorted. But we are calculating the amount 
of kinds, so the kinds of fruit needs to be unique, so no duplicates.

======= 
 Scenario2:
List students' name according to their height.
 
 Collections2:
 ArrayList, Queue, HashTable
 
 Best Option2: we allow duplicates, and students are tested by order, and the result is sorted. 
 So Queue.
 
========
 Scenario3:
 List all the member's name in a club.
 
 Collections3:
HashMap, LinkedHashMap, ArrayList.
 
 Best Option3: there might be duplicate names, and don't have to be sorted.
 As there will typically be a member id, and it's unique and one member one key, so HashMap is the best option.
